Class Definition:
The Product class is defined with an uninitialized private field _productName. 
The leading underscore is a convention indicating that it's intended to be a private field.


Getter (ProductName):
The class has a getter method named ProductName. When you access ProductName on an instance 
of the Product class, it returns the current value of _productName.

Setter (ProductName):
The class has a setter method also named ProductName. It takes a parameter newName 
and attempts to set the value of _productName based on certain conditions.
If the role is "admin," it sets _productName to the new value (newName).
If the role is not "admin," it writes a message to the document indicating that the role is not authorized to set the product name.



Usage Example:
An instance of the Product class is created: let myProduct = new Product();
The setter (ProductName) is used to set the value of _productName: myProduct.ProductName = "New Product";
The getter (ProductName) is used to retrieve the value of _productName: console.log(myProduct.ProductName);

Role and Username:

The role and username variables are used in the setter to determine whether the role is authorized to set the product name.
Document Output:

If the role is not authorized, a message is written to the document using document.write.
